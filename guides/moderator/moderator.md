# SAP Online Track Moderator Guide

Hi all @moderators. This guide is meant to help you in your role. If you have any questions or suggestions for changes in this guide, please ping one in the @admin team. And remember to look out for each other, and help if you can. You people are awesome, and we couldn't do this without you. ‚ù§

## Code Of Conduct
One of the most important parts of the moderators, are to make all people feel welcome and safe. Please get acquainted with the Code of Conduct of SAP Online Track, either on the [website](https://saponlinetrack.github.io/code-of-conduct) or in the [Discord channel](https://discordapp.com/channels/679820722553618451/680501448211038265/687232653111459843). If you experience any situation in clear violation, you are expected to intervene. On Discord you have the ability to kick and ban people who does not want to comply to the code of conduct. If you need to get a participant removed during a session live chat, please ping the responsible stream producer, who can take action.

_Always seek a non-confrontational resolution, by first trying to guide the person in question. Remember that we are a diverse group, from all around the world, and that cultural differences and language barriers can lead to misunderstandings in written communication._

## On Discord
On Discord, you might expect to be contacted by people with questions. Please guide them as best you can, and divert them to the @admin team if you can't give a clear answer. Remember to be friendly in your communication. As a moderator, you are a community ambassador.

Try to be as active on Discord as you are able to, during the event. If you see someone trying to start a conversation without any luck, take the time to engage the person. You can be the one that make a difference to this person. And this might also start more conversations between the members.

## During sessions
Since we have pivoted our setup, there is need for your help during the event. The chat is now moved to the livechat on YouTube, and the speakers will need help to get the questions from the chat. We would like you to do that. We also need help to raffle out openSAP reactivation codes during the sessions, among the audience. 

### Task list:
- Navigate a web browser to https://wheelofnames.com/ws2-m2g. This is the web app we use for the raffles.
- Join Livestream voice channel 10 minutes before the event starts. The speaker should be there already. Coordinate with the speaker, how they want the Q&A; During the session, or in the end. Remember to mute your mic when not speaking.
- Track questions from the live chat. 
- Ask questions in voice chat to the speaker
- Announce in the live chat the following message for the raffle.  "Welcome to the session, we are so pleased you could make it.  We are running a raffle in each session to win OpenSAP reactivation codes, if you are keen to enter, please write you name in the live chat.  We'll collect the names and announce the winner towards the end of the session.  Enjoy learning and good luck winning a prize"
- Please collect the names from the people in the live chat on youtube  that want to be in the raffle and put them into the Raffle worksheet in the google sheet document pinned in the moderators chat. Find the session code and put all names down vertically. Then we have a fallback if the spinning wheel fails
- Copy the names of the attendees and enter them in the Wheel of names app.
- Spin the wheel, and pick a winner. You don't have to share your browser for this. 
- Report the winner to the @admin team and in the live chat.
- Additionally we have created a form that we would like you to share while announcing the winner and ask them to submit few details.  https://bit.ly/saponlinetrack-rafflewinner . All the submitted details will be available in the Sheet (https://bit.ly/saponlinetrack-rafflecontacts). This information should be enough for us to validate the winners. 
- Ping the stream producer when the session is about to wrap up. The producer might be monitoring up to 3 streams at the time. 
- If a speaker joins a livestream before their allocated time and whilst another stream is still in progress, remove them from the livestream track (by right clicking on their name and click Disconnect).  If it continues, send them a polite message in the speakers channel to wait until their allocated time.
- Drop a message in the live chat about our interactive whiteboard. Something like "Check out our interactive whiteboard at https://awwapp.com/b/ucqrr23vqfvoc/ .  Feel free to write a message or tag your love for the event"  
- Please keep track of time as we run a tight ship, if a session go over, kindly ask the presenter to wrap it up and continue in the unconference channel.
- If you have any questions throughout the session, instead tagging individual people from the organisers team. Please tag @admin 
- Enjoy yourself. Without you this wouldn't be possible. Thank you so much for your help &#128588;
